[Ehsan Forootan](https://vbn.aau.dk/en/persons/149382) is full professor in Geodesy and Earth Observation at the Department of Planning, Aalborg University (Aalborg-PLAN), Denmark. He received his PhD in Geodetic Engineering from the Institute of Geodesy and Geoinformation, University of Bonn, Germany in 2014. Ehsan works on improving satellite geodesy products for various applications namely surveying, positioning, and Earth System monitoring. His research focus has been on the processing of satellite remote sensing data including the global measurements of the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and GRACE-Follow On, satellite altimetry, and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). He has also been developing signal-signal and signal-noise separation techniques that is required to maximize the usage of available observations and model simulations for monitoring water redistribution within the Earth system. He has led several studies related to the impact of climate and human on the hydrological processes, for example, within the Greater Horn of Africa, the Nile River Basin, and Ethiopia.

Within _DOWN2EARTH_, Ehsan will oversee the regional validation of hydrological models using in-situ and satellite data.
