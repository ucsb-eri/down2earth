[Rafael Rosolem](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/engineering/people/rafael-rosolem/index.html) is a hydrometeorologist interested in understanding soil-plant-atmosphere interactions from the bedrock to the boundary-layer across multiple spatial scales, especially in developing countries. Rafael applies model diagnostics approaches combining the use of land-surface and hydrological models with fieldwork measurements. Rafael has also contributed to the development and establishment of cosmic-ray neutron sensors for sub-kilometer estimates of root-zone soil moisture across sites in the world. 

Rafael will contribute with his hydrometeorological expertise in _DOWN2EARTH_ to help develop and evaluate hydrological models across a range of spatial domains combining them with in-situ observations and remote sensing products.
