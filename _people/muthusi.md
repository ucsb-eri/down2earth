Flavian Muthusi is a hydrologist working with the [Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations Somalia Project, SWALIM - Somalia Water and Land Information Management](http://www.faoswalim.org/). He joined SWALIM in 2006, and has served the organization’s water resources unit at different capacities. Prior to joining SWALIM, Flavian worked briefly as part time lecturer at the Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology, where he also studied MSc in Agricultural Engineering specializing in Water Resources/Hydrology (2004).
 
In _DOWN2EARTH_ Flavian brings a wealth of experience in monitoring of climate/water resources, field equipment installation, and hydrological analysis, from the 14 years of work in Somalia. His main contribution to the project will be in packages 2 and 3, through provision of climate/hydrology data for Somalia from the existing monitoring network, and analysis of the climate data for water balance modelling. Flavian’s key research interest is in hydrologic modelling of surface flows and flash floods, which are characteristic in the dry lands of the Horn of Africa Region.
