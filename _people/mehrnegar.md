Noohsin Mehrnegar is postdoc in Geodesy and Earth Observation at the Department of Planning, Aalborg University (Aalborg-PLAN), Denmark. Originally from Iran, she got her PhD from the School of Earth and Environmental Sciences at Cardiff University, focused on signal processing and integration techniques based on Bayesian methods, to allow a complementary use of available satellite remote sensing data and models, and consequently to better monitor and understand changes in global ocean mass, land hydrology, and surface deformations. She got her B.Sc. in Civil-Surveying Engineering (2010) form Tabriz University (Iran) and her M.S.c degree (2014) in Geodesy at Tehran University, on the subject of improving the Earth gravity signal using remote sensing data. She joined the _DOWN2EARTH_ in 2021 with the research group of [Ehsan Forootan](https://www.uni-hohenheim.de/en/organization/person/dr-ing-ehsan-forootan).

Noohsin has extenstive experience in analyzing remote sensing observations and hydrological signals, and enthusiastic about using mathematics to understanding physical processes within the Earth system. She will be working within the [Model Development Team](http://down2earthproject.org/model_development/) to implement data assimilation methods into our modeling workflow.
