Andrés is from Ecuador and is interested in surface-groundwater interactions in dryland regions. He strongly believes that numerical models will help us in enhancing our understanding of surface-groundwater processes which in turn will be crucial for water resources management purposes under the consequences of climate change.  

Andrés got his BSc in Civil Engineering at the University of Cuenca in Ecuador and after being awarded a scholarship a Master’s degree in Hydrogeology at the University of Birmingham, United Kingdom. He recently obtained his PhD in the School of Earth & Environmental Sciences at Cardiff University, studying how to improve groundwater recharge estimates from ephemeral streams in drylands. Quichimbo is currently the key hydrological model developor on _DOWN2EARTH_.
