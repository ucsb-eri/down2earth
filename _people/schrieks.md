[Teun Schrieks](https://research.vu.nl/en/persons/teun-schrieks) is a PhD candidate at the department of Environmental Economics of the Institute for Environmental Studies (IVM) at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. He obtained his Bachelor of Science in Economics at the Erasmus University Rotterdam and graduated from the research master Multidisciplinary Economics at the Utrecht University School of Economics in 2019. During his master’s he specialized in behavioural and environmental economics. After his master’s he worked for one year as junior lecturer at Utrecht University School of Economics.

 

For the _DOWN2EARTH_ project, his research will focus on the interaction between policies and human adaptive behavior. He will work on the integration of human decision making theories in an agent-based model on drought risk assessment. He will collect data on human adaptation decisions and the influence of government policies on these decisions, which will be used as input for the agent-based model. With this agent-based model, Teun will simulate different policy scenarios to analyze the impact on future drought risk.
