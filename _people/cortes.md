Isamar is a postdoctoral research scientist working on the DOWN2EARTH project as an ecohydrologist working on her postdoctoral research project which explores drought stress on vegetation within dryland ecoregions. Prior to coming to Cardiff, Isamar earned her PhD from Montclair State University in New Jersey USA. In her PhD work, she explored the effects of climate change on mangrove island systems across the Caribbean through a coupling of remote sensing and numerical modeling. Isamar is focused on understanding the role of drought and climate extremes on vegetation across different landscapes.

Within the DOWN2EARTH team, Isamar brings remote sensing expertise which she uses as current model inputs in the existing project. She looks forward to incorporating her skillset to model development work.
