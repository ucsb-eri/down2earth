[Jeroen Claessen](https://www.ugent.be/bw/environment/en/research/h-cel/staff/jeroen.htm)  has a Masters in Bioscience Engineering: Land and Water Management from Ghent University. He joined the Hydro-Climate Extremes Lab (H-CEL) in 2016 to study climate-vegetation interactions at a global scale. His expertise lies in remote sensing of various hydrological variables and causal time series analysis. As a teaching assistant, he is also responsible for the practical exercises of some of the courses taught at H-CEL.

In _DOWN2EARTH_, Jeroen will combine high resolution remote sensing data with and a causal inference framework to determine how climate affected vegetation in the Horn of Africa. His findings will help identifying regions that already suffered from climate-induced land use change, as well as regions prone to changes in land use in the near future.
