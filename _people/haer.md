[Toon Haer](https://research.vu.nl/en/persons/toon-haer) currently works as an assistant professor at the Institute for Environmental Studies (IVM) at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. His research focusses on the dynamics of adaptation and vulnerability, integrating natural and behavioural processes in risk models across different scales. His research interests include (flood, wind, wildfire, drought) risk and impact analyses, adaptation strategies, economics of adaptation, and applying agent-based models to capture complex risk dynamics. Toon has been a visiting researcher at the University of Maryland and the University of California, Santa Barbara in the United states. Toon holds a bachelor in Technology Management, a master in Energy and Environmental sciences, and a PhD on dynamic adaptation and risk dynamics.

On _DOWN2EARTH_, Toon will be involved in the development of the agent-based model for understanding emergent behaviors between people, the physical environment, and public policy.
