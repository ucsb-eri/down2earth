[Rhoda Odongo](https://research.vu.nl/en/persons/rhoda-odongo) is a researcher and PhD candidate in the Department of Water and Climate Risk of the Institute of Environmental Studies (IVM) at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (VuA) working on the EUH2020 project _DOWN2EARTH_. She received her Bachelor of Science in Bio-systems Engineering from the University of Nairobi, Kenya and a Master of Science in Water Resources Engineering from the KU Leuven, Belgium. Her master thesis compared and analysed different model setting up configurations and sewer inlet representation in urban drainage modelling.

She is involved in the data-driven assessment of drought risk to understand existing and possible future interactions between climate, hydrology, land and water use, and management focusing mainly on the drought and subsurface water storage. Rhoda is interested in quantifying these interactions to figure out which interactions are most important in drought risk analysis.
