Jacob Rigby holds an EngD in Human Computer Interaction from University College London. Prior to this, Jacob completed an MSc by research and BSc in Computer Science at Durham University. He has also worked at the Interactive Technologies Institute (ITI) in Madeira, Portugal. His doctoral research focused on how technology has changed video consumption, and how it fits into peopleâ€™s everyday lives. 

Jacob is currently employed as a postdoctoral research associate working collaboratively with [SCI-CLAWPS]({% link _pages/home.md %}) on the [Mobile phone App Development for Drought Adaptation in Drylands-MADDAD](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/projects/rework-of-mobile-phone-app-development-for-drought-adaptation-in-) project in the [School of Geographical Sciences](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/geography/) at the [University of Bristol](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/). In this project, led by [Dr. Katerina Michaelides](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/geography/people/katerina-michaelides/overview.html), we are researching how to best deploy information technology to benefit Kenyan farmers and pastoralists at risk of drought. Outside of work, he enjoys playing guitar, camper vans, and keeping fit.
