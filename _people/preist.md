[Chris Preist](http://www.bris.ac.uk/engineering/people/chris-w-preist/index.html) is Professor in Sustainability and Computer Systems at the University of Bristol. His research focuses on the application of digital technology (particularly social computing and mobile technology) to engage communities around environmental and social sustainability. He is particularly interested in the design of such systems in participatory ways, and the impact of systems on the practice and behaviour of the communities in which they are deployed.
