[Erik Kolstad](https://www.ewk.no/) is a climate researcher at NORCE and the Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research in Bergen, Norway. While his background is in extreme weather in the Arctic, his research in recent years has shifted to long-range forecasting. He leads the [CONFER](https://confer-h2020.eu/) EU project, which is one of _DOWN2EARTH_’s “sister projects”. In addition, he leads the [Climate Futures](https://www.climatefutures.no/en/home/) centre for climate risk prediction and management.
