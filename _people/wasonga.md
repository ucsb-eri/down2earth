[Oliver Wasonga](https://profiles.uonbi.ac.ke/oliverwasonga) holds a PhD in Dryland Ecology and Pastoral Livelihoods; MSc. Rangeland Ecology; and BSc. Range Management from the University of Nairobi.  He has over 19 years’ experience working in the drylands, and has established linkages with policy makers at national and sub-national levels, as well as pastoralist and agro-pastoralist communities in the greater Horn of Africa. He is currently a Senior Lecturer and Head of Range Management in the Department of Land Resource Management and Agricultural Technology (LARMAT) at the University of Nairobi. 

His latest research work focusses on understanding the impacts of climate change and adaptation mechanisms among the pastoralist and agro-pastoralist communities in the drylands of Eastern Africa. In _DOWN2EARTH_, Oliver is involved in supporting design of the approach for social data collection, field work and stakeholders’ engagement to understand gendered decision-making processes for climate adaptation among pastoralist communities in northern Kenya’s drylands.
