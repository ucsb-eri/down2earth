[Mark Tebboth](https://people.uea.ac.uk/m_tebboth) is an interdisciplinary social scientist whose research addresses issues related to how people and populations respond to and adapt to risks arising primarily from global environmental and, more specifically, anthropogenic climate change. Within this broad area of research, he has particular interests in human migration / mobility and forced displacement, vulnerability, resilience and adaptation, and disaster risk reduction. He is a Lecturer in Environment and International Development in the [School of International Development (DEV)](https://www.uea.ac.uk/about/school-of-international-development) at the University of East Anglia. He teaches on both undergraduate and postgraduate courses covering issues linked to the governance of natural resources, climate change, and migration. Mark Tebboth is the theme co-leader for the [Tyndall Centre's](https://www.tyndall.ac.uk/research/overcoming-poverty-climate-actions) research activities on understanding how to address the twin goals of poverty alleviation and achieving meaningful action on climate change. He also co-leads [Climate@UEA’s](https://www.uea.ac.uk/climate) work on the Critical Climate Decade. He is a member of the [Global Environmental Justice Research group](https://sites.uea.ac.uk/global-environmental-justice) and the [Water Security Research Centre](https://www.uea.ac.uk/groups-and-centres/water-security-research-centre).

Mark has a number of currently active research projects including [Recovery with Dignity](https://www.tyndall.ac.uk/projects/recovery-dignity), a British Academy-funded project focusing on how people recover from disasters in India, a UKRI-ARUA-funded [Transforming Social Inequalities Through Inclusive Climate Actions-TSITICA](https://tyndall.ac.uk/projects/transforming-social-inequalities-through-inclusive-climate-action-tsitica), a Royal Society-funded project looking at [Drought Resilience in East African dryland Regions-DRIER](https://www.tyndall.ac.uk/projects/drier-–-drought-resilience-east-african-dryland-regions) which explores how populations manage the impacts of water scarcity in East Africa, a IDRC-funded project exploring climate resilient development pathways-[CRDP](https://www.tyndall.ac.uk/projects/climate-resilient-development-pathways-semi-arid-regions-africa-and-south-asia) in dryland regions in Africa and Asia. A lot of Mark’s work focuses on the drylands in East Africa and relates directly to his work on _DOWN2EARTH_.

In _DOWN2EARTH_, Mark plays a key research role in the design, implementation and analysis of D2Es work within communities in the three case study countries. He will also contribute to work packages and cross-cutting activities.
