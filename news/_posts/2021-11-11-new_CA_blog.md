_DOWN2EARTH_ team members from [Climate Analytics](https://climateanalytics.org/), have written a [new blog](https://icpac.medium.com/key-priority-areas-in-nationally-determined-contributions-ndcs-in-eastern-africa-f575b1b7dc6b) on Nationally Determined Contributions to mitigate climate change. This team has been focused on researching historical policy on climate adaptation in the HAD region and will be working to develop new policy frameworks as part of the [Policy Development Team](http://down2earthproject.org/policy_development/).
