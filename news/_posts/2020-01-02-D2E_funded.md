Members of the [SCI-CLAWPS](https://singer.eri.ucsb.edu/) team were successful in their major research bid to the EU Horizon 2020 grant program. Their new project, DOWN2EARTH, is aimed at improving information from climate forecasts and projects to support climate adaptation in the drylands of East Africa. The project (led by Singer) will be based from Cardiff University with cooperation from 14 partner institutions across Europe and Africa. We will be recruiting a large team of researchers in spring of 2020, so stay tuned...or send us [email](mailto:bliss@eri.ucsb.edu) to express early interest in being involved.
