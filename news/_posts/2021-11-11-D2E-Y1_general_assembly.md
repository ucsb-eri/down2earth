The EU Horizon 2020 funded _DOWN2EARTH_ team held its second all-hand meeting (General Assembly) marking the end of the first year for our project. The 3-hour meeting was attended by >40 people from across the consortium. It consisted of reportage from each of our [Thematic Teams](http://down2earthproject.org/ambition/), as well as from our two sister projects, [CONFER](https://confer-h2020.eu/) and [FOCUS-Africa](https://focus-africaproject.eu/). We welcomed several new project staff and received updates on additional funding gained by consortium members for project-related activities. But the most powerful part of the meeting was the second half, which consisted of long breakout room discussions, which yielded important insights into what is working/not working in _DOWN2EARTH_. It was generally agreed that issues raised in these discussions will be taken on board for reflection and implementation of improvements to our overall project management, stakeholder engagement activities, and dissemintation/communication. Overall, it was a very positive event, and the team is very much looking forward to an in-person meeting in 2022. Stay tuned!
