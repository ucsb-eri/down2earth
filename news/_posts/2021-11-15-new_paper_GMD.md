Various _DOWN2EARTH_ team members from [Cardiff University](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/) and [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/), have published a new [paper](https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/14/6893/2021/) and associated [hydrological model](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5061988) as part of the [Model Development Team](http://down2earthproject.org/model_development/). This new model, DRYP, will form the backbone of various activities on _DOWN2EARTH_ including seasonal water forecasts, future climate change projections of water scarcity, and the development of policies using agent-based models. We will be working to regionalize this catchment model across HAD in the coming months.
