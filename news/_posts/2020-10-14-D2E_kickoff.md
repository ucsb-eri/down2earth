Members of the EU Horizon 2020 funded _DOWN2EARTH_ team met virtually for our project kickoff meeting, in which we introduced key team members, outlined the project rationale, aims, and ethos, heard perspectives on needs from people in the Horn of Africa Drylands, and learned about project management and practicalities. We also got overviews on the larger European Commission programme related to climate adaptation and how our project fits it, as well as briefs on EU Horizon 2020 sister projects [CONFER](https://confer-h2020.eu/) and [FOCUS-Africa](http://focus-africaproject.eu/). It was a well-attended event with ~60 participants from across Europe and Africa, which included an inagural address from Cardiff University Vice Chancellor, Colin Riordan.
