Members of the DOWN2EARTH team met up in Amsterdam for our General Assembly. It was a fun and productive meeting in which we mapped out a set of targets and a timeline for delivering on the promises of our project in the remaining 16 months. We held meetings at the [REM](https://rem.amsterdam/en/), an old pirate TV station on a platform, and at IVM. We also had a field trip to [Amsterdamse Waterleidingduinen](https://awd.waternet.nl/), the dunes used for Amsterdam's drinking water supply and a historic water pumping
station (containing the largest boiler on Earth) at the [Cruquius Museum](https://www.haarlemmermeermuseum.nl/en/cruquius-museum--world-largest-steam-engine).
