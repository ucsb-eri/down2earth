Members of the DOWN2EARTH team met up in Kenya for our final General Assembly. It was a fun and productive meeting in which we mapped out a set of targets and a timeline for delivering on the promises of our project in the remaining 6 months. We held stakeholder meetings beforehand in both Addis Ababa (Ethiopia) and in Nairobi (Kenya). The main GA was held in beautiful Naivasha, where the team worked hard to outline remaining activities and responsibilities on DOWN2EARTH and to plan for project reporting. It was a very successful meeting that culminated in a circle of appreciation and a clear plan to deliver impact to the HAD.
