Members of the EU Horizon 2020 funded _DOWN2EARTH_ team had a strong presence at the [57th Greater Horn of Africa Climate Outlook Forum (GHACOF)](https://www.icpac.net/ghacof-57/). EU Horizon 2020 sister project [CONFER](https://confer-h2020.eu/) also made a strong showing. Both consortia were involved in Co-Production Sector meetings on Feb 15th, in Sector meetings on Feb 16 focused on the impacts of the consensus seasonal forecast, and in the main GHACOF meeting on the 17th. In the latter, Michael Singer gave a [presentation](https://t.co/0bqIcyv5ic?amp=1) about what _DOWN2EARTH_ is promising in terms of novel climate services to the Horn of Africa Drylands. Overall, it was a well-attended event with ~300 participants from across region and beyond. And it was a great learning experience for the _DOWN2EARTH_ team! We look forward to playing a more active role in future GHACOFs.
