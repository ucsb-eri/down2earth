<br /><br />**_DOWN2EARTH_ assembles a multidisciplinary project team, composed of experts and specialists in social science, rural development, media communication, climate science, meteorology, environment, hydrology, policy analysis, GIS, remote sensing, computer science, decision-support, modelling, and dryland processes. Below is a description of our project organization and a list of consortium institutions.**  

# Organization
Efficient, fair, and participatory project management is critical to the success of large research and innovation effort such as _DOWN2EARTH_. Our project contains the following.     
### Management Board<br>
The _DOWN2EARTH_ Management Board consists of a gender-balanced collection of PIs from each partner in the consortium. The Management Board meets at least quarterly and is responsible for overseeing and directing the research and implementation activities, ensuring fruitful interactions across disciplines and teams. 

### Thematic Teams<br>
Our project work is carried out within six Thematic Teams that meet frequently to ensure continuity of key cross-cutting aspects of the project:<br /> 
1. [Community Research, Engagement and Impact (CREI) Team](../community_research_engagement_&_impact)<br /> 
2. [Digital User Engagement Team (DUET)](../app_development)<br /> 
3. [Model Development Team](../model_development)<br /> 
4. [Climate/Water Data Team](../climate_water_data)<br /> 
5. [Policy Development Team](../policy_development)<br /> 
6. [Dissemination and Communication Team](../dissemination_communication)<br />  

### Advisory Board<br />
The _DOWN2EARTH_ [Advisory Board](/advisory_board/) consists of key project stakeholders and meets twice a year to to extend impacts from our project more broadly in the HAD region and internationally, while also strengthening aspects of the project that show great promise with further investment. 

### Sister Project Coordination<br />
The _DOWN2EARTH_ team is proud to work alongside two other [EU Horizon 2020](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en/what-horizon-2020) projects, [CONFER](https://confer-h2020.eu/) and [FOCUS-Africa](http://focus-africaproject.eu/) funded under the same call. We are working closely together to integrate our project work to exploit potential synergies and learn from collective experiences.
