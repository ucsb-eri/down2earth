Mobile phone and web app technology is being extensively used in Africa and elsewhere to provide information, services, and education to people in institutions and rural communities. At its best, digital technologies have advantages over traditional approaches – they can provide cheap, up-to-date information, which is tailored to the needs of the individual receiving it, and relevant to their particular location. 

This aspect of _DOWN2EARTH_, led by the Digital User Engagement Team (DUET), developed/enhanced several desktop and mobile phone technologies for use by agro-pastoralists to access tailored information generated from our hydrological model, [CUWALID](https://down2earthproject.org/CUWALID/). These provide information from seasonal forecasts (for the upcoming rainy season) on soil moisture storage, groundwater storage, and crop yields for a set of different crop types for a given user’s location, as deviation from a defined baseline condition. The main service, a social media chatbot, [WujihaCast](https://down2earthproject.org/WujihaCast/), was designed in such a way that it provides this information that is tailored to the specific context of agro-pastoralists in HAD, based on researched use cases. They  also present information in a way which is sensitive to their culture and existing practices, so it can be easily interpreted and acted upon.
