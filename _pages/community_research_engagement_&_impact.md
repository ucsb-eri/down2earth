In the _DOWN2EARTH_ project, we are engaging, learning from, and co-developing research with agro-pastoralist communities in HAD; analyzing the historical policy environment in HAD with respect to water scarcity and food insecurity; and analyzing the risks of climate change within agro-pastoralist communities and the feedbacks that arise from unforeseen interactions between climate, policy, and human behaviors. The broader goals of the Community Research, Engagement, and Impact (CREI) Team are to develop a strong understanding of the issues faced in agro-pastoralist communities in HAD with respect to climate change adaptation, including distinct gendered perspectives, to incorporate these perspectives within policy analysis and future policy development, and to explore the interactions between humans, climate, and policy within an interdisciplinary agent-based modeling framework that will yield new understanding of emergent behaviors based on these interactions. 

The CREI Team's objectives are to:
1. Understand gendered decision-making processes of dryland communities for climate adaptation
2. Identify existing water management and food security policies and evaluate their efficacy an 
3. Analyze interactions between climate and policy and their impacts on human society.

The information generated in CREI Team's activities will be used elsewhere in _DOWN2EARTH_ to inform: 
* creation of media content on climate change adaptation designed to reach and engage end-user agro-pastoralists; 
* climate change adaptation policy development; 
* app development; and 
* analyses linking human activities (e.g., land use) to regional climate change within water storage and crop yields.
